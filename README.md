# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior, we aim to identify factors contributing to churn and provide actionable insights.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoding categorical features, VIF, Transformation and Scaling for better model performance.
- **Modeling**: Implemented Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and LightGBM and along with Hyperparameter tuning for each algorithms.

## Tools Used
- Python (Data Analysis libraries, Scikit-learn, Scipy, XGBoost, LightGBM & SHAP)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `Telecom_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` to explore the analysis.

## Results
Achieved an accuracy of 81% & Recall of 84% with the Random Forest model.
